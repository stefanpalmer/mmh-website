                    <p>
                        The project “Cold Winter, Warm Children” was a donation of 240 blankets 
                        for infants and children for hospitals in Bitola, Delcevo, and Stip, in 
                        Macedonia. The Fund for Macedonian Children was a program organized by the 
                        non-profit organizations United Macedonian Diaspora, Splash of Hope, and 
                        the Macedonian Mission for Humanity. The fund had the goal of investing 
                        in the creation of an effective humanitarian program for helping children, 
                        with the objective of a better future for the whole Balkan region. For 
                        this project, the foundation also collaborated with the non-profit 
                        organization ATTE (Association of Technical and Technological Education).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The funds for this project were collected from various Macedonian 
                        organizations and individuals from around the world in the course of one 
                        month. All the donations were used for buying the blankets from the 
                        factory Teteks.

                    <p>
                        Macedonian Mission for Humanity and the Steamboat Kiwanis Club loaded and 
                        shipped a 40-foot container of aid items aimed for Macedonia. Included in 
                        the container are 120 computers for schools; several thousand books for 
                        libraries promoting English training; hundreds of bags stuffed with 
                        clothing; skis for the Red Cross kids program and ski patrol; assorted 
                        sports equipment; and many more items. Thanks to the generosity of the 
                        Steamboat community and a grant from the Kiwanis International Foundation, 
                        this project has been possible.

                        A special thanks to the members of the Steamboat Kiwanis Club, Tim Miles 
                        and Dave Holloway for their help in acquiring unwanted middle school and 
                        high school computers, donated storage from Central Park Warehouses, 
                        loading help from Steamboat Home Consignment, Kiwanis and Coldwell Banker, 
                        and the generous donation of funds and merchandise from the Steamboat 
                        Springs community. It’s a great project that will be of considerable value 
                        to those within Macedonia.

                        Hundreds of used computers and reading materials have been assembled with 
                        the help of the Steamboat Springs Rotary Club for shipment to Macedonia 
                        for distribution to local schools and libraries in the region. About 175 
                        of the computers were obtained from the Steamboat Springs School system – 
                        units replaced with new machines under a special grant. Others were 
                        collected from other Rotary clubs in Colorado and from private donors. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Funding for the project was provided through a grant from the Steamboat 
                        Springs Rotary Club. Additional matching funds were sought through other 
                        foundations. There are 12 schools that received the computers. These 
                        schools had fewer than 10 computers despite the fact that high speed 
                        internet service is readily available in the country because of a project 
                        funded through USAID grants.

                        Many students living in Steamboat Springs wouldn’t give coats and boots a 
                        second thought. But for many students living in Macedonia, coats and boots 
                        are luxury items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steamboat Springs resident Vesna Palmer, who is from Macedonia, asked 
                        the local Kiwanis Club to donate money to a nonprofit Macedonian group to
                        purchase 40 coats and 10 pairs of boots for several minority Turkish
                        female students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Buying a coat is a six-month salary for most families,” Palmer said 
                        Wednesday. “The whole region is very poor. I know the need there and there 
                        is a tremendous need there.” Palmer moved from Macedonia more than 20 
                        years ago. She said winters in Macedonia, a landlocked country on the 
                        Balkan peninsula in southeastern Europe, are very similar to Steamboat 
                        Springs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The girls who received the coats live in three remote villages in Eastern 
                        Macedonia. The coats allow the girls to attend education classes provided 
                        through a nonprofit organization called INFOBUS - a mobile education 
                        service designed to reach disadvantaged communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Without the coats and boots, the girls were walking three or four miles 
                        to get to the classes,” she said. “In Muslim communities, girls are less 
                        exposed to education. They often don’t go. It is very difficult for them.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Macedonian Coats 4 Education Project is the first international 
                        project the Steamboat Kiwanis Club has undertaken. Steamboat Springs 
                        Rotary Club also has sent computers, books and donated clothing to 
                        Macedonia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Palmer said she is eager to send more items to Macedonia, but shipping 
                        costs can be prohibitive. That’s why the Kiwanis Club chose to send money 
                        to Macedonia to purchase coats.

                        pianist Kalina Mrmevska. This recital was part of the ongoing Macedonia/
                        Colorado cultural exchange program.

                        Ms.Rusthoi was a selected artist performing at three major summer festivals

                        BitolaFest. Now an exciting professional talent, Keri Rusthoi studied with 
                        the eminent Jean Kraft of the Metropolitan Opera. She received her operatic 
                        training from the Manhattan School of music, earned a master’s degree in 
                        Vocal Performance from the University of New Mexico, and completed

                        During intermission, the audience enjoyed the photography exhibit “Love 
                        Macedonia” presented by Macedonian-American photographer Zoya Naskova. 
                        Refreshments were served. Admission was free, but a $10 donation was 
                        suggested. All proceeds from this event went to fund shipping cost for

                        The stand organized by the Macedonian Mission for Humanity was one of the 
                        most visited on the international night in Steamboat Springs. Over 300 
                        visitors saw the movies One Day in Macedonia and Ohrid Lake, and they got 
                        more familiar with the beauty that Macedonia has to offer.

                        Visitors showed special interest in the projects for cultural and 
                        educational exchange between Macedonia and Colorado, which began with the 
                        gallery of the Macedonian-Canadian artist Michael Close.
